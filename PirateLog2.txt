**Pirate Captain's Log**
**Day 237, Year of the Sea Serpent**
	The wind howls through the rigging as our ship, *The Black Revenant*, cuts through the storm-ravaged seas. Today was a day of unexpected fortune. We spotted a lone vessel adrift in the fog, an easy prize for a crew with our... talents. The ship was a merchant vessel, battered and barely afloat, as though it had encountered something far worse than the usual pirates.
	At the heart of the wreckage, we found him. A high-ranking prisoner-a man of great importance. His clothing was torn, his once-pristine uniform now stained and ragged. We took him aboard without much resistance. He was a high-born officer from the Empire, one who, judging by his demeanor, had seen battle and commanded soldiers. His name is **Lord Aldric Vael**, but there's something wrong.
	His eyes are vacant, his movements slow and disoriented. The fool can't even remember who he is. *Not a flicker of recognition* when we tossed him into the brig. I'd wager he was part of some high-profile diplomatic mission, though his memory of it is nothing but a shadow. 
	We tried everything-interrogation, threats, promises of gold-but his mind is a fortress crumbling under its own weight. He remembers nothing of his past, no family, no rank, no empire. Only his name-and even that seems unsure, as if it's someone else's. The storm did something to him-perhaps a blow to the head, or worse, the sea has stolen his mind along with his memories.
	But there's something strange in his eyes, something beneath the fog of his confusion. I've seen men break under the pressure of their own mind before, but this... this is different. Perhaps it's all a ruse. Or perhaps this broken man is of far greater importance than any of us realize.
	**First Mate's note:** Keep him under constant watch. If his mind returns, so too will his value. If not... we may have an opportunity for leverage. Either way, we'll extract something useful from this.
	For now, we wait. And we watch. 
	We may have caught a high-born noble, but if his memories don't return, we might just have an asset we can use for our own purposes.
